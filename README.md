# Operationalizing Machine Learning pipeline in Azure

This project demonstrates how to use Azure to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it. IN addition it involves how to create, publish, and consume a pipeline.

## Architectural Diagram

1. **Authentication** : In this step, we need to create a Security Principal (SP) to interact with the Azure Workspace.
2. **Automated ML Experiment** : In this step, we create an experiment using Automated ML, configure a compute cluster, and use that cluster to run the experiment.
3. **Deploy the best model** : Deploying the Best Model will allow us to interact with the HTTP API service and interact with the model by sending data over POST requests.
4. **Enable logging** : Logging helps monitor our deployed model. It helps us know the number of requests it gets, the time each request takes, etc.
5. **Swagger Documentation** : In this step, we consume the deployed model using Swagger.
6. **Consume model endpoints** : We interact with the endpoint using some test data to get inference.
7. **Create and publish a pipeline** : In this step, we automate this workflow by creating a pipeline with the Python SDK.
